# Anscombe-s-quartet-dataset

## Background
------------------------------------------------------------------------
The jupyter notebook is analysis and investigation of Anscombe's Quartet. 
Anscombes's Quartet was constructed in 1973 by the statistician Francis Anscombe to demonstrate both the importance of graphing data before analyzing it and the effect of outliers on statistical properties.

The jupter notebook contains background information to the datasets. 

The notebook runs sequentially starting with descriptive statics on the datasets and following on to various linear regression visualisations, comparisions and pairplot to highlight the correlation withing the datasets but more importantly the differences within the data sets not evident from the descriptive statistics.
